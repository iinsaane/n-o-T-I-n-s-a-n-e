Hi, im Rares (M15) but i usually go online by the name insane! Im very passionate about programming and am constantly learning new things! I am from romania but i am planning to study abroad at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US. 

I am skilled in python, javascript ( web / node ), php, markup languages ( html, css ) and willing to master a lot more!
